# Project #1: Build a Game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Flashcards v0.1: By Matthew Anderson

A flashcard application for learning JavaScript terms.

- Technologies and references:
    - I used the [Bootstrap v5 framework](https://getbootstrap.com) to begin building my **HTML** and **CSS**, then added a few bits of **Bootstrap JS** functionality to enable the *answer reveal* and future *new card* abilities.

- Approach taken:
    - I knew I wanted to experiment with **Bootstrap**, because it seemed like a neat framework to learn. I spent my first day just reading through [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/), then began to experiment with basic layout and styling elements. Once I created the initial layout, adding cards was easy. I just needed to figure out how to reveal the answers. I decided a simple popover was good as a minimum, with the *flip card* function coming in the next version. I also set up the framework of the *new card* function, but there wasn't enough time to enable that feature during this sprint.

- Installation instructions:
    - None

- Unsolved problems / coming features:
    - Next iteration, new card feature (allow users to add new cards dynamically)
    - Refactor popover answers to flip function
    - Figure out wrapping and card creation so that the cards do not fill the screen lengthwise (research Bootstrap card groups and functionality)
    - Add self-scoring mechanism
    - Decks (other topics)?
