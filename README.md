# Project #1: Build a Game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
## Flashcards: By Matthew Anderson

A flashcard application for learning JavaScript terms.

- Technologies and references:
    - I used the Bootstrap v5 framework to begin building my HTML and CSS, then added a few bits of Bootstrap JS functionality to enable the "answer reveal" and future "new card" abilities.

- Approach taken:
    - I knew I wanted to experiment with Bootstrap, because it seemed like a neat framework to begin with. I spent my first day just reading through documentation and "Getting Started" guides, then began to experiment with basic layout and styling elements. Once I created the initial layout, adding cards was easy. I just needed to figure out how to "reveal" the answers. I decided a simple popover was good as a minimum, with the "flip card" function coming with a future iteration. I also set up the framework of the "new card" function, but there wasn't enough time to enable that feature during this sprint.

- Installation instructions:
    - None

- Unsolved problems / coming features:
    - Next iteration, new card feature (allow users to add new cards dynamically)
    - Refactor popover answers to flip function
    - Figure out wrapping and card creation so that the cards do not fill the screen lengthwise (research Bootstrap card groups and functionality)
    - Add self-scoring mechanism
    - Decks (other topics)?
